==============================================================================
	Release Notes for Alpha Code of GeneConnect Web Application
==============================================================================

Features available:
--------------------------
1. Simple Search functionality.
2. Advanced Search functionality(without path selection).

Known Issues:
---------------------------
1. Only the annotations data is available now so the application is testted excluding alignment based data.

Following features will be included in Beta release:
--------------------------------------------------------
The Select path button on advanced search is disabled due to following changes on the page.

1. ONT selection page will have {Paths, Path Type, Starts With, Ends With} options for filter criteria as described below:
	Paths:
	1.All Paths all possible paths between data sources should be displayed

	2.Subset of Input and Output data sources available
		Paths having subset of Input and Output data sources available should be filtered.

	3.All Input data sources and subset of Output data sources available:
		Paths having all the Input data sources and any of the Output data sources should be filtered.

	4.Subset of Input data sources and all output data sources.
		Paths having any of the Output data sources and all the Input data sources should be filtered.

	5.All Input and Output data sources available
		Paths having all Input and Output data sources available should be filtered.

	6.Only all Input and Output data sources available
		Paths having only all Input and Output data sources should be filtered.

	7.Starts with any Input data source and Ends with any Output data source (intermediate data sources can be any)

	8.Starts with and Ends with any Input / Output data source, covers all Input and Output data sources. (Current implementation and default filter,  Paths satisfying this criteria should be shown as default result)

	9.Starts with any Input data source and Ends with any Output data source (intermediate data sources can be any) and all Input Output data sources have been covered.

	10.Paths traversing Input data sources first and than Output data sources


	Path Type:
	1.Alignment-based
		Paths having one of the links of the type Identity or Alignment should be filtered. Identity link type should be selected by default as link type in the list box of the link type and if Identity link type is not available than Alignment link type should be selected by default. 
	2.Non-Alignment
		Paths having one of the links of the type Direct of Inferred should be filtered. Direct link type should be selected by default as link type in the list box of the link type and if Identity link type is not available than Inferred link type should be selected by default. 

	Note: Options All and Shortest will not be retained in Beta release.

	Starts With:
		List of all selected Input and Output data sources should be available along with Any option.

	Ends With:
		List of all selected Input and Output data sources should be available along with Any option.

 

2. Paths displayed on ONT selection page should show Any option in the link type list box between two data sources if possible links between those two data sources are more than one.

3. If user selects a path with Any option selected for any of the two data sources of the path, link type should be displayed as {Any} in the Selected Paths list box, while different possible paths should be displayed in the Highlight Paths list box on the Graph. And for the path selected with Any link type should add all possible paths in ONT Collection of search criteria.

4. Select Path button remain disabled until user specifies at least one Input data source and Output data source.

5. ONT selections on the ONT selection page should be retained if User goes back to Advance Search page from ONT selection page and comes back without changing list of the Input and Output data sources.
